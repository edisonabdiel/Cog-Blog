## Why Like This?

The app was initialised from scratch in order to asure a smooth integration between React - Next - TypeScript - TailwindCSS. 
Also built with a GraphQL API to allow for a more dynamic and scalable experience which integrates perfectly with the GraphCMS API. 

The UI is meant to be minimalistic yet engaging was built using SASS for global styles and TailwindCSS to allow grat control and autonomy over the layout of the app 
and also the design and feel of the elements within it.

<p>all characters and posts are fictional and used for demo porpuses only</p>

## Getting Started

Install the dependencies 

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn add install
```

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Build 

```bash
npm run build
# or
yarn build
```


Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/comments). 
This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/comments/index.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
